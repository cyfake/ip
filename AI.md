# AI Usage Record

This document tracks my usage of AI tools during the development of my Baymax Chatbot.  
I primarily used **ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5)** to assist with writing and refining **JavaDocs** for my codebase.

## Times Used:

- Generated initial drafts of JavaDocs for core classes (`Parser`, `Command`).
- **Observations:**
    - The AI produced well-structured documentation quickly, saving me time compared to writing everything manually.
    - This was especially true for the `Command` classes, since they were already well-structured and clearly defined. The AI was able to generate meaningful, accurate documentation with minimal edits needed.
    - I still needed to review and refine the comments to ensure accuracy and alignment with the actual implementation.
- **Time Saved:** Estimated 1–2 hours.

---

- Updated JavaDocs after code refactoring (e.g changes in method signatures and new helper methods).
- **Observations:**
    - AI was useful for quickly adapting old JavaDocs to new method structures.
    - However, it was sometimes over-ambitious and tended to **over-document** methods and classes with unnecessary detail or repetitive phrasing. I had to simplify the output to keep the documentation concise and relevant.
- **Time Saved:** About 1 hour.

---

- Asked AI for suggestions on restructuring my code while transitioning from a CLI-based application to a GUI-based one (A-JavaFX).
- **Observations:**
    - The AI proposed various design patterns and refactoring strategies, but many of them were overly complex for the scale of my project.
    - Ultimately, I chose not to adopt its suggestions and instead implemented a simpler restructuring approach on my own, which was more manageable and better suited to my needs.
- **Time Saved:** None. The AI provided a useful perspective, but I relied on my own approach in the end.

---

- Asked AI for suggestions on restyling the GUI to better fit a Baymax-themed color palette.
- **Observations:**
  - The new color scheme blended better with the overall Baymax aesthetic, making the UI more cohesive and friendly.
  - The use of subtle shades kept the design from feeling too aggressive.
- **Time Saved:** About 30 minutes, as the AI provided curated color suggestions and hover/pressed styling that I could apply directly without trial-and-error.

---

## Overall Reflection
- Using AI for JavaDocs was effective for **boilerplate drafting** and **style consistency**.
- The main limitation was that I had to **verify technical correctness** myself, since ChatGPT doesn’t analyse my actual codebase in detail.
- Overall, I would estimate that AI saved me around **3-4 hours** in writing the JavaDocs myself.
- Future use: I plan to continue using AI for **documentation support**, but less so for implementation or debugging.
